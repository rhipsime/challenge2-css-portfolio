## Overview
As a part of a web development challenge, I created this portfolio to demonstrate proficiency in HTML, CSS (including Flexbox), media queries, and JavaScript for smooth scrolling effects. The portfolio is designed to be responsive, adapting to various screen sizes and devices.

## Features
- Responsive design with Flexbox and media queries
- Smooth scrolling effect for navigation links
- Showcase of my work with titled images and links to deployed applications (As I don't have anything yet to link to in my portfolio, the link goes to another website for now to demonstrate my ability)

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

## Screenshots

## Usage
- Use the navigation bar at the top to jump to different sections: About, Work, and Contact.
- Click on the application images in the Work section to open the deployed projects.
